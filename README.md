# OOP-Related-Bugs-Study-ICSE25-Artifacts
This is the project repository of our ICSE 2025 research paper: A Comprehensive Study of OOP-Related Bugs in C++ Compilers.
The project involves 2 folders and 1 summary table file(precisely 8 c++ source files and 2 forms).

---

## dataset

---
This folder contains a summary form file that records the entire detailed information of all the bug reports we explored during our empiricial study, including each of the report's id in its bug repository, its creation date, symptom, priority and severity, title, its bug type and the corresponding sub type according to our classification criteria, necessary compiler options needed provided by the bug presenterï¼ˆprobaly not simplest) and modern c++ new features involved in its test code. All of the diagram and statistics provided in our paper can be completely exported from this form.

## buggyFiles

---

This folder contains the real bugs that has not been discovered by other means in GCC and LLVM which we obtain from our cross-project validation experiment. The comment at the beginning of the file points out the compiler version that we discovered the bug. We have submitted bug reports for each of the tests in this folder

---
## keywords
---
This file involves the keyword set that we used to fliter OOP related bug reports from the repository. Note that we have manually reconfirmed the reports after getting them with script
