## Explaination for repeated submission of #4.cpp
---
It's unexpected that when we performed cross validation on GCC and LLVM for this test generated by **OOPFuzz** and had a close look at the result, we found both of the compilers behave somewhat incorrect. First, the code should be invalid because the type conversion statement from class *C* to *B* is invalid before *C* is complete. Clang frontend incorrectly accepted this, while gcc gave the following error message:
```c++
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<source>:5:42: error: '&B::y' is not a constant expression when the class 'B' is still incomplete
    5 |   constexpr static bool b=(int(A::*))&B::y;
      |                                          ^
```
That is not accurate, since merely using *&B::y* without the type conversion operation is valid, and we have confirmed that on both GCC and LLVM. We consider it should be different bugs although the test is the same, thus it's necessary to submit it on both compilers.
